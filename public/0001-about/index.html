			<h1>About</h1>
			
			<p>Bruh, Ltd is a collection of random web pages, such as demos and art projects, that were created for questionable reasons. All of the pages are placed in a sequencial order and linked to each other with secret links, which you should navigate. This page contains one too.</p>
			
			<p>The bruh.ltd domain also hosts instances and landing pages of some projects. Feel free to guess how you can find them out.</p>
			
			<p>If you have a random web page and you believe it belongs here, feel free to submit a <a href="https://gitlab.com/kirbykevinson/bruh.ltd/-/merge_requests">merge request</a>. Your page will gladly be accepted as long as it's under a free and open source license.</p>
